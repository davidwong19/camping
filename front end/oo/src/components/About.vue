    <h1>Find Yourself Outside</h1>
    <p>Get more people outside</p>
    <p>Move with purposeful urgency.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We take action with the urgency that our 
      mission deserves. We focus on learning faster so <br>
      that we can invest in the most important things. <br>
      We achieve more with less by creating <br>
      systems at the right scale (sometimes with duct tape.) <br>
      We are intentional about when we move fast and when 
      we are more considered.</p>
